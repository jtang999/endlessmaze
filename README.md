# Simple Adventure Game: Endless Maze
Hi, thanks for your interest in playing my game!

This is a simple text game you can play in your terminal. Explore a randomly generated fantasy land, encounter monsters and magical plants, and see what happens when you try and break the game. It'll be fun!

### How to run the game
Fork the repo or download the files to your computer. Make sure `endlessforest.py` and `labyrinthmaker` are in the same directory (the .txt files are optional). Then, from terminal, open up the directory with `endlessforest.py` in it and simply run `python endlessforest.py` and enjoy!
